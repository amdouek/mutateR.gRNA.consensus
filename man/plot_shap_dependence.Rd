\title{Generate SHAP dependence plots for specific features}
\usage{
plot_shap_dependence(
  shap_result,
  features = NULL,
  color_by = "auto",
  ncol = 2,
  rasterize = NULL,
  raster_dpi = 300
)
}
\arguments{
\item{shap_result}{Output from analyze_feature_importance()}

\item{features}{Character vector of feature names to plot. Default NULL uses top 4 features.}

\item{color_by}{Character. Feature to use for coloring points.
Default "auto" for automatic selection based on interaction strength.}

\item{ncol}{Integer. Number of columns in plot grid (default 2)}

\item{rasterize}{Logical. Rasterize points for large datasets (default TRUE if n > 5000)}

\item{raster_dpi}{Integer. DPI for rasterisation (default 300)}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (combined with patchwork if available) or list of ggplot objects
}
\description{
Creates dependence plots showing the relationship between a feature's
value and its SHAP contribution, optionally colored by an interaction feature.
