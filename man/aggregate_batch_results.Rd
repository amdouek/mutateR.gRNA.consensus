This function is called automatically at the end of \code{\link{run_exome_analysis}},
but can also be called manually to re-aggregate results or after manually
adding/removing checkpoint files.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Re-aggregate results after manual checkpoint manipulation
aggregate_batch_results("exome_analysis")

# Load the aggregated results
results <- readRDS("exome_analysis/final_results.rds")
}
