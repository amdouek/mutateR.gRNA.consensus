\usage{
summarize_score_agreement(
  multi_scores,
  methods = NULL,
  modern_methods = NULL,
  legacy_methods = NULL,
  top_n = c(10, 20, 50),
  cor_method = c("spearman", "pearson")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{multi_scores}{Data frame returned by \code{score_grnas_multi()}.}

\item{methods}{Character vector. Subset of methods to analyse (default: all).}

\item{modern_methods}{Character vector. Methods considered "modern" for tiered analysis.
Default: c("deepspcas9", "deephf", "ruleset3") for Cas9,
c("deepcpf1", "enpamgb") for Cas12a.}

\item{legacy_methods}{Character vector. Legacy methods to model separately.
Default: c("ruleset1") for Cas9, NULL for Cas12a.}

\item{top_n}{Integer vector. Thresholds for top-N overlap analysis (default: c(10, 20, 50)).}

\item{cor_method}{Character. Correlation method: "spearman" (default) or "pearson".}
}
\value{
A list of class "score_agreement" with components:
\itemize{
\item correlations: Data frame of pairwise correlation coefficients
\item correlation_matrix: Matrix form for heatmap plotting
\item rank_overlaps: Data frame of top-N overlap statistics
\item summary_stats: Per-method summary statistics
\item tiered_consensus: Tiered consensus metrics (modern, robust, legacy divergence
\item discordant_examples: gRNAs with largest rank disagreements (modern methods only)
\item legacy_divergent: gRNAs where legacy methods most diverge from modern consensus
\item concordant_top: gRNAs ranking well across methods
\item method_clusters: Hierarchical clustering of methods by correlation
\item metadata: Analysis parameters
}
}
\description{
Computes correlation coefficients, rank overlap statistics, and tiered
consensus metrics to quantify agreement between on-target scoring methods.
Explicitly handles legacy methods (e.g., RuleSet1) that may systematically
differ from modern deep learning approaches.
