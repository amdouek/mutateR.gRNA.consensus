Title: Cross-Methodology On-Target gRNA Scoring Feature Analyses
Version: 0.0.0.9000

    person("Alon", "Douek", , "Alon.Douek@monash.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Extends mutateR with tools for comparing CRISPR gRNA on-target 
    scoring methods, analyzing agreement/disagreement between RuleSet1, 
    DeepSpCas9, RuleSet3, and DeepHF (Cas9) or DeepCpf1 and enPAM+GB (Cas12a).
    Includes SHAP-based feature importance analysis to identify sequence 
    features driving scoring method predictions and disagreements. Supports
    exome-scale parallel analysis with checkpointing and fault tolerance.
